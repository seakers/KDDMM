% 2D Orientation Heuristic
% This function evaluates the orientation of members in a 2D NxN design,
% and assigns a score based on whether the average orientation of members
% is biased towards either the vertical or horizontal directions.  The
% target angle is based off of a logistic function
% -----------------------------------------------------------------
